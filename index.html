            Created by four men eager to protect the enviornment, NSS Zoo was
            made with the sole importance of conservation in mind. All our
            facilities are state of the art, carbon nuetral enviornments with
            animal care at the fore front. Not only does NSS Zoo care for its
            own animals, but with climate change on the rise, NSS has taken a
            position at the front defense by contributing a large portion of our
            proceeds directly to global conservation efforts. We hope you join
            us one day at the Zoo to see our amazing and unique animals!

            Brand new to Nashville, NSS Zoo was created by our founders Tom
            Clouse, Devin Garcia, Noah Husain, & Jonathan Watson in April of
            2021.

            Committed to the increasing needs of suitable housing for exotic
            animals, NSS Zoo has start of the art technology to ensure that our
            animals are kept comfortable and safe during their time with us.
          </li>
          <li>
            During the initial planning of our company, our four founders
            shattered the industry standard of using sketchbook to form the
            design of our site and instead drew all our plans on a microsoft
            paint file. This file can be found in our main hall.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quickly becoming of the hottest locations in Nashville, NSS Zoo has
            seen some of the largest growth nationwide when compared to other
            zoo's.
          </li>
          <li>
            Charitable donations are nothing new to NSS Zoo as 20% of our
            proceeds go directly to wildlife conservation efforts around the
            globe ranging from the plains of Europe to the sahara's of Africa.
