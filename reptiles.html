          <p>
            Reptiles are tetrapod animals in the class or clade Reptilia
            /rɛpˈtɪliə/.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a class in Linnean taxonomy, Reptilia refers to a paraphyletic
            grouping comprising all amniotes (vertebrates which encase their
            embryos in a series of protective sacs) except synapsids (mammals
            and their extinct relatives) and Aves (birds). The class Reptilia
            comprises turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards,
            tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of the traditional
            reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern
            amphibians, is called herpetology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Operating under the modern evolutionary principle of cladistics,
            many paleontologists and herpetologists have redefined Reptilia as a
            monophyletic clade containing all modern reptiles (in the
            traditional sense), and any other descendant of their last common
            ancestor. This includes birds, which are a subgroup of archosaurs
            and more closely related to crocodilians than to any other modern
            animal.[1] The clade Reptilia could alternatively be defined as
            referring to animals more closely related to modern reptiles than to
            mammals. This definition would make Reptilia synonymous with the
            clade Sauropsida.[2]
          </p>
          <p>
            The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million
            years ago during the Carboniferous period, having evolved from
            advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted
            to life on dry land. The earliest known eureptile ("true reptile")
            was Hylonomus, a small and superficially lizard-like animal. Genetic
            and fossil data argues that the two largest lineages of reptiles,
            Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha
            (lizards and kin), diverged near the end of the Permian period.[3]
            In addition to the living reptiles, there are many diverse groups
            that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events.
            In particular, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out
            the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, ornithischians, and sauropods,
            alongside many species of theropods, crocodyliforms, and squamates
            (e.g., mosasaurs).
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern non-bird reptiles inhabit all the continents except
            Antarctica. Several living subgroups are recognized: Testudines
            (turtles and tortoises), 361 species;[4][5] Rhynchocephalia (the
            tuatara from New Zealand), 1 species;[4][6] Squamata (lizards,
            snakes, and worm lizards), about 11,052 species;[4][7] and
            Crocodilia (crocodiles, gharials, caimans, and alligators), 27
            species.[4][8]
          </p>
          <p>
            Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four
            limbs or, like snakes, are descended from four-limbed ancestors.
            Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage.
            Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates
            are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades[9] – the fetus
            develops within the mother, using a (non-mammalian) placenta rather
            than contained in an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are
            surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt
            them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species
            feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to
            those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their
            hatchlings. Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko,
            Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to 17 mm (0.7 in) to the
            saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, which can reach 6 m (19.7
            ft) in length and weigh over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).

          <li>
            Lizards can’t feel warm or cold the way we can. But their movements
            and speed are affected by the outside temperature. So for instance,
            while they can’t feel cold, cold will make them slow. Imagine
            instead of saying “I feel cold” you would simply not be able to move
            as quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evidence of the earliest reptiles dates back to 312 million years
            ago.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although reptiles are often found in warm areas, they actually
            inhabit every continent but Antarctica.
          </li>
          <li>All reptiles use lungs to breathe.</li>
          <li>
            Reptiles shed their skin periodically. The younger they are, the
            more often they shed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reptiles’ skin is watertight, meaning they do not get soggy and
            water does not penetrate their scales.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reptiles digest food slower than mammals do. This is due to a slower
            metabolism but also the fact that many reptiles do not masticate (or
            chew) on their prey. Many just swallow it whole.
